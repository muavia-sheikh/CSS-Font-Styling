    <h1>The Philosophy of Miyamoto Musashi — The Dokkōdō</h1>
    <p>
      In my previous post, I spoke about the fictional version of Miyamoto
      Musashi and his journey to growth and self-improvement. The young man who
      goes from beast to someone seeking the path of enlightenment. It is a very
      inspiring story, I spoke about it in detail, it is my favorite piece of
      fiction, but where the true value in Musashi’s teaching lies in the
      principles that he embodied and wrote about near the end of his life — The
      Dokkōdō. A simple yet detailed view of his philosophy and way of life:
    </p>
    <br />
    <ol>
      <li>Accept everything just the way it is.</li>
      <br />
      <li>Do not seek pleasure for its own sake.</li>
      <br />
      <li>Do not, under any circumstances, depend on a partial feeling.</li>
      <br />
      <li>Think lightly of yourself and deeply of the world.</li>
      <br />
      <li>Be detached from desire your whole life long.</li>
      <br />
      <li>Do not regret what you have done.</li>
      <br />
      <li>Never be jealous.</li>
      <br />
      <li>Never let yourself be saddened by a separation.</li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Resentment and complaint are appropriate neither for oneself nor others.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>Do not let yourself be guided by the feeling of lust or love.</li>
      <br />
    </ol>
